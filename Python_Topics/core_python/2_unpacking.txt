we can have unpacking assignments like

a,*b,c,d=[1,43,54,346,658,354,35,6]

here a=1, d=6, c= 35 , b=[43,54,346,658,354]

*b in assignment refers that this variable supports

Here above we done with list, but it is supportable 
with tuples , but not strings and 
not iterators

despite of whatever we unpack , when assigned
variables contain multiple values like of b above
then they will always be list.

but when we unpack dictionaries only if keys are strings
d= {'1234':5467 , 'a' :3465}
and we need to use ** and moreover this can be only
used for passing keyword arguements to functions
print(**d) or a=**d will throw error
>>>def add(a=0,b=0):
	return a+b
>>>kwargs={'a':10,'b':8}
>>>print(add(**kwargs))
18

the thing that we get from **kwargs cannot be stored.
It is actually stored by assigning the values to multiple variables
which are keyword arguements,hence we can access value
of a inside above add function
