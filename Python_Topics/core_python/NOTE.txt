
ALL OF THESE FILES CONTAIN IMPROPER KNOWLEDGE INSTEAD GO REFER TO CPYTHON INTERNALS BOOK


In these all files of this folder we have used standard library and other 
libraries for explanaing core python concepts

in python everything is instance of some class which is hierarchy of inheritance
of object class the mosty basic building block of python language.

But term object is loosely used in python.It means

TypeError: 'str' object is not callable

here python wants to say object as "instance" and not the most basic building 
block class object of python

But in our texts whenever we will use term object then it will mean that most basic 
building block class named as object only

we will not term objects as instance of classes , instead we will use the word "instances" explicitely there
