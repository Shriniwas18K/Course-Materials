In this whole folder we have wrong assumptions of internal python structure.

It was attempt made on 13thJuly 2024 to understand internal python
structure, but it was found that it relies whole on Cpython interpreter
inside.

Production level doesnot require of such in depth knowledge
Instead required is knowledge of libraries of specific domain using python

These files contain still correct syntax but there use is not recommended

Python is just simply about libraries and nothing about performance
and internal depths.
In python focus is on doing tasks neatly and as per expectations and
a lot on increasing functionality , and not on optimizing time and space complexity

Here by we saw our machine doesnot support ML DL stuff , nor GenAI,
we feel frustated to write web react code that increases very fast in lines
and its too much abstractions.

We head forward to building backend codes and web scraping mastery.
