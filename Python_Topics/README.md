In this whole folder we have assumptions of internal python structure.

It was attempt made on 13thJuly 2024 to understand internal python structure, but it was found that it relies whole on Cpython interpreter inside.Still the concepts written here are sufficient for mastering python usage and writing less code for morew functionality.

Python is just simply about libraries and nothing about performance and internal depths.In python focus is on doing tasks neatly and as per expectations and enhanced readability and a lot on increasing functionality , and not on optimizing time and space complexity

Here by we saw our machine doesnot support ML DL stuff , nor GenAI, we feel frustated to write web react code that increases very fast in lines and its too much abstractions.
