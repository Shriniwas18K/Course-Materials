java has 7 primitive data types and remaining everything are classes.
Its by core object oriented language with static typing.

It has both compiler and interpreter.Compiler catches checked exceptions 
and interpreter is JVM which catches runtime unchecked exceptions.

JVM is actually virtual machine. It has objects representing memory
like registers.It translates code given in class files into its 
assembly language inside JVM.

From SE 8 onwards it added support to functional programming paradigm.
SE 8 is standard version used everywhere.

Everything in ecosystem is built on specification.Java SE8 is built
on java language specification JLS.Similarly Jersey framework is built
on JAXRS specification.Similarly HIBERNATE ORM is built on Bean validation
specification JRS380.Specification like JAXRS contains interfaces and 
abstract classes which provide description like how things should be done 
and implementation has concrete classes which provides what things 
should be done in Jersey framework.
